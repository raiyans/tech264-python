# Python variable basics

### What is a Variable in Python?
It acts like a container that holds data, such as numbers, strings, or more complex types, that you can refer to later in your code. You can assign a value to a variable using the = operator. 
 
### Why is it Called a Variable?
It is called a "variable" because the value it holds can change or "vary" throughout the execution of the program.
