"""
Write a Python script to write a 'Hero story'
Purpose

Practice what you've learnt about Python dictionaries
The task

First part

Define a dictionary called story1. It should have the following keys:
'start', 'middle' and 'end'
Print the entire dictionary
Print the type of your dictionary
Print only the keys
Print only the values
Print the individual values using the keys (individually, lots of print commands)
Now, let's add a new key:value pair:
'hero': yourSuperHero
Hints:

THE MORE CREATIVE THE BETTER
If time

Improve the program. For example, can you make it a "Choose your own adventure" story?
"""

story1 ={"start":"there was a house on fire","middle":"","end":""}
print(story1)
print(type(story1)) #prints a set type
print(story1) #prints a set type
